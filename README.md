# Fish Weight Prediction Flask App

This repository contains a Flask application that predicts the weight of fish based on their physical measurements and species. The application utilizes a machine learning model trained on the Fish Market dataset.

## Overview

The Flask app provides a simple web interface where users can input the species and physical measurements of a fish (such as length, height, and width). It then returns a prediction of the fish's weight. The machine learning model behind this app is built using a Random Forest Regressor.

## Dataset

The Fish Market dataset includes various fish species with measurements such as weight, vertical length, diagonal length, cross length, height, and width. The dataset is used to train a model that predicts fish weight based on these features.

## Features

- Predict fish weight based on species and physical measurements.
- Web interface for easy interaction with the prediction model.
- Flask backend to process user inputs and display predictions.

## Prerequisites

Before running this application, you will need:

- Python 3.6 or higher
- Pip for installing Python packages

## Setup and Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/fish-weight-prediction.git


2. Navigate to the cloned repository's directory:

cd fish-weight-prediction


3. Install the required Python packages:

pip install -r requirements.txt


4. Run the Flask application:

flask run

javascript
Copy code

Alternatively, if you have specified `app.py` as your Flask application entry point:

python app.py



## Usage

Once the application is running, open a web browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000`. Enter the fish's species and measurements as prompted, then submit the form to receive a weight prediction.


## Contributing

Contributions to improve the application or the underlying model are welcome. Please follow the standard GitHub fork-and-pull request workflow.
